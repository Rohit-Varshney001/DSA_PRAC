1.) Given an array of integers num and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such they add up target.

2.) Given an array of integers num, find the sub array with the largest sum and their sum.

3.) Given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day. You want to maximize your profit  by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day to sell that stock . Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. else return 0 (LC: Best day to buy and sell stock)

4.) You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day. Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve. (LC: Best day to buy and sell stock 2)

5.) Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets (nums[a], nums[b], nums[c],nums[c]) such that 0<=a,b,c,d<n &&&& a,b,d are distinct  &&&& nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target (LC 4Sum)
